# Minimum Operations

## Description

In this project, we write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` H characters in a text file. The text editor can execute only two operations:

- **Copy All**: Copies all the characters in the file.
- **Paste**: Pastes the copied characters.

##  Parameters:
n (int): The target number of H characters.

## Returns:
An integer representing the minimum number of operations needed to achieve n H characters. If n is impossible to achieve, returns 0.

## Function Prototype

```python
def minOperations(n)
