#  Rotate 2D Matrix

## Description

This project involves rotating an `n x n` 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise in-place. The algorithm modifies the matrix directly without using extra space for a new matrix. This operation is a common problem in matrix manipulation and involves matrix transposition and row reversal.

## File Structure

- `0-rotate_2d_matrix.py`: Contains the implementation of the `rotate_2d_matrix` function.
- `main_0.py`: A test script to demonstrate the use of the `rotate_2d_matrix` function.

## Function Prototype

```python
def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
    """
    Rotates a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise in place.

    Args:
        matrix (list of lists): The n x n 2D matrix to rotate.

    Returns:
        None: The matrix is modified in place.
    """

## Usage

To test the rotation function, run the `main_0.py` script:

```bash
$ ./main_0.py
[[7, 4, 1],
 [8, 5, 2],
 [9, 6, 3]]
